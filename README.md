# Hogwarts Potions

This is a web application that uses API requests to access and maintain a database.

## Technologies what I used:
*   Entity Framework Core
*   Code-first approach
*   SQL Server database connection
*   Asynchronous programming

## Usage:

User has to run SQL server. In my application, in "appsettings.json" file, user can add the connection string.
The database created by the application automatically.

After run the application, API endpoints can be reached through requests, using Postman or any software.
